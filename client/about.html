          Hello! I'm a high school student with a passion for creating dynamic and engaging programs ranging from multiple different sectors. I enjoy working with modern technologies and continuously learning new skills to improve my craft. In my free time, I love exploring new programming languages, creating new projects, and sharing knowledge with those around me.
        </p>
        <p class="hidden">
          Outside of programming, I enjoy working out, reading, playing video games, and spending time with friends and family.
        </p>
